About
=====

pdfmerge4unix has been written in 2003 by Didier F.B Casse <didier@microtronyx.com>.
In 2010 it seemed pretty discontinued, so Dominic Hopf resumed this work to fix
some issues reported to the Fedora package of pdfmerge in the meanwhile.


Usage
=====

The usage of this small but nice tool is pretty easy. Have all your files in
one directory, change to that directory and run something like

 pdfmerge file1.pdf file2.pdf... fileN.pdf outfile.pdf

=======

You can get the sources via

 git clone https://github.com/dmaphy/pdfmerge.git
