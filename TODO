TODO
====

- also check for the mode of the files to be merged (should not be
  word-writable; 644 shoud be suitable for PDF documents, shouldn't it?)

- use File::Temp to generate a temporary file in /tmp instead of .merged.ps

- try to avoid the repetition of unlink("./merged.ps");, maybe write a
  quit() sub or something similar
